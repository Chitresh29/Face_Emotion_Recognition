**Face Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning**

This project employs deep learning techniques to recognize emotions from facial expressions. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with the Keras framework, the system processes facial images and predicts the corresponding emotions, such as happy, sad, or surprised. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled facial expressions, allowing it to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.

**Technologies Used:**

Keras and TensorFlow:
Keras provides a high-level neural networks API, and TensorFlow serves as the backend. These libraries are fundamental for building and training deep learning models.

OpenCV (cv2):
OpenCV is used for image processing tasks, including face detection and image manipulation. It enhances the preprocessing of facial images before feeding them into the neural network.

NumPy:
NumPy is a powerful library for numerical operations in Python. It is employed for handling arrays and matrices, crucial for data manipulation in the context of deep learning.

Pandas:
Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. It helps organize and structure data, especially when dealing with labeled datasets.

Face Emotion Recognition Model (CNN):
The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network architecture implemented with Keras. The CNN is trained on a dataset containing facial expressions labeled with corresponding emotions.

JSON:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is employed for model serialization. The trained model's architecture is saved to a JSON file, and the weights are saved separately.

Webcam and Video Feed:
The OpenCV library is utilized to capture video frames from a webcam, allowing real-time face emotion recognition from a live video feed.

This project showcases the application of deep learning in recognizing emotions from facial expressions, demonstrating the capabilities of neural networks in image classification tasks.
